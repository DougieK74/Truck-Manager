# Includes:
# - Truck visualization
# - Color-coded cargo
# - Load optimization (non-overlapping)
# - Route, cost, and driver shift calculations
# - Multi-truck support
# - Load density and balance alerts
# - AI truck selector (from mock fleet)
# PDF output excluded for now (to reduce load time and complexity for presentation)

# Actual implementation code will follow in next step (split across segments if needed)
