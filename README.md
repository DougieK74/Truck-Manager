# Truck Load Optimization Prototype

This is a prototype logistics app built using Streamlit. It allows users to:
- Enter shipment details (size, weight, destination)
- Visualize how shipments fit in a 50ft x 8ft flatbed truck
- Check for overweight loads
- View estimated remaining capacity

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Features

- Interactive shipment form
- Load optimization visualization (top-down truck layout)
- Simple truck capacity tracking

This is a basic MVP to demonstrate logistics optimization potential. Ideal for development of AI-powered load sharing and carbon-saving features in future versions.
